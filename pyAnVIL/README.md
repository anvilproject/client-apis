# pyAnVIL: terra + gen3

A python client integration of gen3 and terra
* gen3==1.0.1
* firecloud==0.16.24

## Use cases

As an AnVIL data analyst, I need to retrieve the:
* namespace
* workspaces
* workspace schema
* workspace entities
from terra

> As an AnVIL informaticist, in order to create cross project cohorts, I would like to query across those projects


> As an AnVIL informaticist, having created a cross project cohort, in order to derive novel results, I would like to run a workflow using files from that cross project cohort

> As an AnVIL data analyst, I need those projects mapped to the AnVIL schema (Note, the schema is a future deliverable)
