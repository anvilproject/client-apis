> As an AnVIL informaticist, in order to create cross project cohorts, I would like to query across those projects


> As an AnVIL informaticist, having created a cross project cohort, in order to derive novel results, I would like to run a workflow using files from that cross project cohort

> As an AnVIL data analyst, I need those projects mapped to the AnVIL schema (Note, the schema is a future deliverable)
